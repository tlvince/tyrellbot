Tyrell watches the public Twitter stream and rephrases tweets with a negative sentiment to a positive one... or that's the idea anyway :)

Check out some of its tweets here: <https://twitter.com/tyrellbot>.

Whipped up in a few hours during [robots for peace](http://www.peacebots.org/) hackathon, London, 2017-09-23. Don't take the code too seriously ðŸ™ˆ
